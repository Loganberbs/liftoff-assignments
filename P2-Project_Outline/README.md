## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I had the Idea of making a grocery list app because I frequently made lists on my phone, using educated guesses to make the list that usually resulted in forgotten items or buying items I already had. I want to make an app that remembers what you have and can give an estimate of when I should get more of it. The user should be able to make their first list and submit what they've purchased (or taking a picture of the receipt.) The next list will incorporate the items the user has inventoried from last trip, allowing them to easily see what they have, don't have or need to pick-up. The user can also keep track of expiration dates or ripening phases with bananas or avocados. I want to build an app that helps me eliminate time spent running errands and waste in my wallet and kitchen. 


### Features
Generate List: Users will have the ability to generate a shopping list from scratch and save the information for viewing later.

Edit List: Users can mark-off or cross-out any items in real time, updating what is left.

Inventory: Items the user checks-off the list are stored in a "pantry" file with a timestamp so that they can remember what they already have or need to get for the next list they generate in the future.

Bonus: Users can transfer their list to the online store of their choice for curbside pickup or delivery.
